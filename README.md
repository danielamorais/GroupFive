#Mass movement control
> Software developed to foresee the mass movement and to help getting a fast evacuation of the people at risk area

The Embedded System is fastened at a risk area and is responsible to collect and analyse metadatas. Datas such as soil humidity and device position are important factors to consider. the probability of the mass movement to occur in risks areas is higher and occurs slowly along the time, not instantly.<br>
Thanks to the datas we can monitor how susceptible to slipping is that area.
