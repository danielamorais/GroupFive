#Control of Mass Movement
> Software developed to prevent the mass movement and help to get a fast evacuation of the people in risk area

The Embedded System is fixed in some risk area and is responsible to collect and analyse metadatas.
Datas about humidity of soil and position of device are an importants factores to consider, the probability of the mass movement occur in risks areas is more higher and occurs slowly along the time not instantly.<br>
Thanks to the datas we can monitor how susceptible is that area.
